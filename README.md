### Important:

1. I did submit this before, but since you wanted this to be **exactly** the way it is on figma, I had to remove most of the section settings (like card aspect ratio, among other settings) and hardcoded most of the CSS values, like gradients, heights, widths, gaps, etc, which is something I wouldn't do in production unless strictly requested like in this case.
   
2. The original design was full of weird values `gap 7.28px`, `font-size: 13.2448px`, `width: 219.38px`, `border-radius: 6.39px`, etc. So I hardcoded most of the CSS values based on the request **"If it’s off by even a few pixels — it won’t ship."**
